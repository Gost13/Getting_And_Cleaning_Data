=========================================

Source repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data course in Coursera.org

This repository contains:

* `README.md`: current file
* `run_analysis.R`: R Script which cleans and summarizes the provided data found. Original data can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
* `tidy_data.txt`: Output data generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
* `CodeBook.md`: Markdown file explaining the contents of the `tidy_data.txt` file, transformations performed, resulting data and variables.

run_analysis.R
-------------------

In order to make fucntion work, please make sure that the linked zip file has been downloaded and extracted inside the working directory.

Once done, `run_analysis.R` can be sourcedfrom within any R environment, and then the function `run_analysis()` can be run, without any additional parameters.

This will load all the required data from the unzipped folder, perform the necessary manipulations and finally generate the `tidy_data.txt` file inside the same folder.

For further details about the exact manipulations performed on the data, please refer to the file `CodeBook.md`.
